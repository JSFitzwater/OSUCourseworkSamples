CS 325 Analysis of Algorithms

Project 3:
This assignment, "The Travelling Salesman Problem," focused on employing all that we'd learned to research and compose an optimal solution to this NP problem, completing a set of tours inside specific tour lengths. I opted to explore the Hill Climbing technique.

Project 2:
This team assignment, "Coin Change," focused on deploying three techniques to returning correct change using the fewest number of coins: Divide & Conquer, Greedy, and Dynamic Programming solutions.

Project 1:
This team assignment, "Maximum Sum Subarray," taking as input an array, iterated and output the subarray with the maximum sum. Completing this instruction used looping Enumeration, Linear-timed, and Divide & Conquer techniques.


Course Description: 
Survey of asymptotic running time analysis, recursion, divide and conquer, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, linear programming, computational complexity (P and NP), randomization, and approximation algorithms.
