CS 344 Operating Systems I

Project 2 Description:
This assignment, "Adventure," required generating in C a pseudorandom map and interactive playable experience from the command line using the generated rooms. Further, players can retrieve the current time. The program relies upon an understanding of file reading-writing, as well as mutexes and multithreading.

Project 3 Description:
This assignment, "Small Shell," required composing a shell program in C, supporting background and foreground command execution, signal handling, as well as "exit," "cd," and "status" built-in command support.

Project 4 Description:
This assignment, "One-Time Pad," required composing principle and adjunct programs that support encrypting and decrypting information using a one­time pad­like system. This assignment combined the multi­processing code we'd learned with socket­based inter­process communication; ran from a command line using standard UNIX features like input/output redirection and job control; and required the addition of a short compilation script.


Course Description:
Introduction to operating systems using UNIX as the case study. System calls and utilities, fundamentals of processes and interprocess communication.
