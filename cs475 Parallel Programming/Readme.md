CS 475 Parallel Programming

Project 7 Description:
This assignment, "Autocorrelation using CPU OpenMP, CPU SIMD, and GPU OpenCL," deployed techniques from all platform integrations we'd seen in search for a harmonic frequency within signal information.

Project 6 Description:
This assignment, "OpenCL Array Multiply, Multiply-Add, and Multiply-Reduce," involved variations upon multiplying sets of arrays using variable array and local work sizes, then comparing resulting benchmark performances.

Project 5 Description:
This assignment, "Vectorized Array Multiplication," required testing array multiplication as well as testing with a reduction (all accounting for SIMD SSE and non-SIMD formatinons). Testing employed variable array and local work sizes, which were used to compare resulting speed-up benchmark performances.

Project 4 Description:
This assignment, "Functional Decomposition," employed parallelism structures (using "pragma omp section" statements) to create a month-by-month simulation of a grain-growing operation, complete with grain growth, animal consumption, precipitation, temperature, and a variable crop threat.


Course Description: 
Survey of parallel programming, including a discussion of parallel architectures, parallel programming paradigms, and parallel algorithms.
